# Intelligent detection module for malicious behavior of Android software
We effectively detect the Android system's sensitive permission calls on the Android software basic framework layer code. Static detection and dynamic detection are Combined together by using the intelligent algorithm of support vector machine(SVM) and related technologies of droidbox to intelligently analyze the behavior of the software. As a result, a light Android-side malware detection software is implemented to identify malicious behaviors.
